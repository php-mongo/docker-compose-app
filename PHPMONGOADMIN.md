## About PhpMongoAdmin

PhpMongoAdmin is a Web-based MongoDb management console, written in PHP and leveraging great tools like Laravel and Vue.
The familiar interface allows you to manage many aspects of your MongoDB installation:

- MongoDB server status and overview.
- Databases overview.
- User(s) authentication and authorization.
- Collections and objects management.
- Importing and exporting data.
- Processing overview.
- Administration tools.

PhpMongoAdmin is accessible, easy to setup, easy to learn and provides plenty of tools required for day to day MongoDB management.

## Learning MongoDB

PhpMongoAdmin provides full [documentation](https://phpmongoadmin.com/support/documentation) along with some video tutorials, making it a breeze to get started with the management interface.

If you've used other tools like PhpMyAdmin or the old RockMongo application then you'll find that using PhpMongoAdmin will be very familiar.

## Quick Install (default mode)
This application currently supports a quick-install script for Linux distributions with Apache: tested on Centos & Ubuntu.  
The default installation location is: /usr/share/phpMongoAdmin  
We recommend using a website that supports SSL to access the application: https://your-domain.com/phpmongoadmin   
Execute the following command as a sudo user:
- wget https://phpmongoadmin.com/installation/default.sh -O - | bash
- After the first stage completes, you will be given several choices for beginning the second stage of the installation process
- You will get prompts for the following information and choices:
    - Will the installation be available for public access?
    - Select an environment: ( production, staging, local are valid choices )
    - Turn debugging mode on|off ( 'off' is recommended for all environments except local )
    - The URL you will access the application with ( mostly used for logical references )
- Once the process completes you can load the application and set-up the Control-User
    - ( you will need the MongoDB credentials )
- !! Never expose a MongoDB server to the public domain without activating secure access !!
    - https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/auth/
- The easiest way to get started is use the mongodb username/password as your control user
    - This provides instant access after logging in to the application
- Alternatively use the mongodb credentials to create a Server-Configuration after you have logged-in with your choice of user/password
- More options are [detailed here](setup/SETUP.md)

####PhpMongoAdmin can be installed in numerous configuration, with more to come. Read out [installation docs](https://phpmongoadmin.com/support) for more options
