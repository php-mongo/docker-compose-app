## About PhpMongoAdmin

PhpMongoAdmin is a Web-based MongoDb management console, written in PHP and leveraging great tools like Laravel and Vue.
The familiar interface allows you to manage many different aspects of your MongoDB installation:

- MongoDB installation status and overview.
- Databases overview.
- User(s) authentication and authorization.
- Collections and objects management.
- Importing and exporting data.
- Processing overview.
- Administration tools.

PhpMongoAdmin is accessible, easy to setup, easy to learn and provides plenty of tools required for day to day MongoDB management.

## Learning MongoDB

PhpMongoAdmin provides full [documentation](https://phpmongoadmin.com/support/documentation) along with some video tutorials, making it a breeze to get started with the management interface.

If you've used other tools like PhpMyAdmin or the old RockMongo application then you'll find PhpMongoAdmin to be very familiar.
